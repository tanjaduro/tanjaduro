Hi, I'm Tanja.

I build AI features from idea to production.
My focus is the intersection of ML engineering and product thinking:
define success, ship reliably, and iterate based on measurable outcomes.

Based in Berlin. Open to remote, hybrid, onsite, or relocation.

What to click first
- mlops-quickstart
  FastAPI inference service with CI gates, tests, and Docker.
  Goal: a reusable template that ships in minutes.

- StarSmiles
  Dental imaging ML demo evolving from notebook to deployable showcase.
  Includes evaluation notes, limitations, and a user-facing demo story.
  https://github.com/tanjaduro/starsmiles

- martha-scribe-bot
  Automation bot focused on integrations, secure config, and reliability.

How I work
- I start with a goal and success criteria (metrics, guardrails).
- I prefer reproducible over clever (locked deps, one-command run).
- I ship with reliability basics (timeouts, retries, logs, CI gates).
- I care about cost and operability, not just correctness.

Looking for
AI Product Builder, product-focused ML Engineer, or Technical PM for AI.
